## TODO

boarders doesn't work
polybar doesn't work
remove commends from config files/clean up configs
rofi fonts are not correct
something is wrong with shortcuts
polybar doesn't seem to work well, only the first bar is loaded
polybar doesn't have opacity
there is something wrong with the gtk theme.

## NOTES
